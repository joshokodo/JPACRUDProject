## JPACRUDProject Week 8
This project simulates a basic web based app for reading, creating, updating and
deleting bounty entities using JPA and a Spring API configuration.

##Summary
This web app allows the user to do a general search for an entity from the home page
(similar to a google search) or the user can do a detailed search of specific paramaters
from detail search from the navigation above. The user also has the ability to delete or update
an bounty found. The user can also add a new Bounty to the database from the navigation option
on the top of each page. All bounties can be found at once at any time from the option up above
in the navigation portion of a page.

##Lessons Learned

connected to the Spring project.
