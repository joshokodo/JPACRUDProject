## Week 8 Homework: JPACRUD Project

### Overview
This program was to assigned to test and practice using basic C.R.U.D. operations on a connecting database using JPA and a Spring API configuration. We used JSP's specifically to make the front end. 

#### Operation/Description of how the program works:
This web app allows the user to do a general search for a bounty entity from the home page
(similar to a google search) or the user can do a detailed search of specific paramaters
from detail search from the navigation above. The user also has the ability to delete or update
an bounty found. The user can also add a new Bounty to the database from the navigation option
on the top of each page. All bounties can be found at once at any time from the option up above
in the navigation portion of a page.

#### Lessons Learned
- The most difficult part of the project was getting a good grasp of how the JPA project
connected to the Spring project.

#### Problems/Issues
- I found the only problem was using this new technology for the first time. I had to rely heavily on previous examples and lessons
 


#### Stretch Goals
- I wanted to make the front end look a little less basic
